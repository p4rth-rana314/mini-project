        <b>Rules:Gameplay</b><br>
        White moves first, then players alternate moves. A player wins by
        checkmating their opponent's king, or if their opponent resigns or runs
        out of time. A game is drawn if it ends in a stalemate, by agreement of
        both players, or if the 50-move rule is reached. <br />
        <b>Time controls</b><br>
        Some competitions use time controls, such as 20 minutes with a 5-second
        delay. If a player exceeds their time limit, they lose the game unless
        they are checkmated. <br>
        <b>Scoring</b><br>
        Players earn points for wins, draws, and losses. For example, a player
        might earn 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a
        loss. <br>
        <b>Tiebreakers</b><br />
        If players are tied in points, tiebreakers may be used to determine the
        winner. These tiebreakers may include the number of consecutive wins,
        total game wins, or fewest game losses. <br />
        <b>Irregularities</b><br />
        If an incorrect starting position is discovered, the game is canceled
        and restarted. If an illegal move is made, the game returns to the
        position before the irregularity. <br />
        <b>Player conduct</b><br />
        Players are not allowed to do anything that would bring the game into
        disrepute. <br />
        <b>Arbiter</b><br />
        The arbiter ensures that the Laws of Chess are followed and makes
        decisions in the best interest of the competition.
